SAXS experiment determines 1-dimensional structural information,
termed SAXS profile, which is the scattering intensity of a molecule
as a function of spatial frequency.  The profile can be converted into
a radial distribution function of the molecule with Fourier transform.
The experiment is performed on a purified protein sample in solution,
resulting in a data that is a rotational and conformational average (1
to 3 nm resolution). There are practically no limitations on molecules sizes [5-10]. 
<p>
There are two major approaches to structure prediction using the
scattering profile: (i) ab initio methods vs. (ii) rigid body
modeling.  If the structure of the assembly or its individual subunits
is not available, only ab initio methods can be used. If the structure
of the assembly or its components is known, rigid body modeling
methods can be applied. In rigid body modeling, atomic resolution
models for the studied assembly are generated by docking methods, and
the theoretical scattering profile of the models is compared to the
experimental one.

FoXS is a method for computing a theoretical scattering
profile of a structure and fitting of experimental profile [1-3]. 
FoXS can be used as a basic tool for numerous structural modeling applications with SAXS data:

<ul>
<li> Comparison of solution and X-ray structure conformations
<li> Modeling of different conformation, i.e. model active conformation starting from non-active
<li> Structural characterization of flexible proteins
<li> Assembly of multi domain proteins starting from single domain structures
<li> Assembly of multi protein complexes
<li> Fold recognition and comparative modeling
<li> Determination of biologically relevant state from the crystals
</ul>

The input to the webserver is a PDB format file and experimental SAXS profile
(if available). FoXS computes the theoretical profile and outputs it
as a text file and as a plot of intensity (log scale) vs. q.  The
profile is computed using Debye formula for spherical scatterers [5].<p>

where f<sub>i</sub>(q) and f<sub>j</sub>(q) represent the isotropic atomic form factors of the atoms i and j, and
d<sub>ij</sub> is the Euclidean distance between these atoms.<p>

If experimental SAXS profile is available, FoXS will fit the theoretical profile to the experimental one.
The quality of the fit is measured by &chi; function.<p>

If multiple PDB files were uploaded by the user, in addition to profile calculation for each structure, the server will also run enumeration and fitting of multiple structures to the input profile [1, 4]. See <a href="help2.html">MultiFoXS example</a> for details. 
The method is useful in cases of flexible multi-domain proteins or mixtures (for example proteins that exist as a mixture of monomers and dimers in solution).
If you need to sample the conformational space of your protein, try <a href="https://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/multifoxs/">MultiFoXS webserver</a>.
