<p>Unfortunately, MultiFoXS analysis of your job failed.</p>

<p>This is usually due to incorrect inputs, such as the
"Background adjustment" advanced option being turned on for too-similar
models (resulting in a "At least 3 points are required for
ParabolicFit2D" error).</p>

<p>For more information, please inspect the
<a href="{{ job.get_results_file_url("foxs.log") }}">FoXS log file</a>.</p>

<p>If this is not sufficient information to resolve your issue, please
contact us at

and reference your job ID (the URL of this webpage).
