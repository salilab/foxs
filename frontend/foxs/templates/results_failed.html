<p>Unfortunately, your job failed to produce any plots.</p>

<p>This is usually due to incorrect inputs, such as:</p>

<ul>
   <li>SAXS profiles containing only negative intensities</li>
   <li>All points in profile being above the maximal q value</li>
   <li>Wrong profile units (1/nm vs 1/&Aring;)</li>
   <li>PDB/mmCIF file containing no atoms (e.g. it is a coarse-grained model)</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information, please inspect the
<a href="{{ job.get_results_file_url("foxs.log") }}">FoXS log file</a>.</p>
